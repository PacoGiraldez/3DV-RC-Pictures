--Paco, Mo 11.04 -- 

Working pretty fine. 
Walls pose weird cases:
· Image PeopleRoom.jpg -- right wall is detected as huge obstacle
· Image BallCubeCylinder.jpg -- grey upper background detected as obstacle. But we shoud IDEALLY find a way to ignore obstacles that are too high (in case we have tables or so).
